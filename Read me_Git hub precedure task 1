# About this repository

The first assignmet of the course computional meethod requires to modify the provided matalb code for the 1D integral by trapezoid rule. The code should be modified in a way that the computional time will be 10 times less. To do that one the foolowing procedure has been done.

1-instead of loop the vetocr has bee nuse.
2 The vector definatino is modifiend ( to avid calulate sme arrays several times.
3- I found that if directly use the commnad it will be more fast to tuse the function.

The debuger is used to the what arrays are similar and find error ( if ther eis)
Porfiler is used to see which commnnad is taking most of computional time.


In the next step, in the git hub, the resipority named " my_cmim2018# is created. The matlab file and the gitignore has bee ncopied to above folder. Then, I tired to make some commnet in the matlab to see how it will interact with matlab. 
1-by right click on the name of the function in matlab add them to git. Then in the folder I saved the file. Roght click open git bash. 
git status to see which file is changes.
git add .
git commit _" trapezoid ..." 
git push
user name and pas word. 

Then if you refresh the git hub and click  on the commnet you can see all changes has bee ndone in matlab.
