# About this repository

This repository is a companion of the "Computational Methods in Mechanics" course that is held at Lappeenranta University of Technology in 2018. 

It includes an exemplary `.gitignore` file. In the future also some code snippets will be included. Stay tuned and remember about `git pull`!

The supplementary material for the course are available at [Moodle](http://moodle.lut.fi).
